# SmartWeaver

SmartWeaver learns how your character values stats based on real combat performance and can automatically equip upgrades when you leave combat.

## Features
- Tracks your DPS or HPS from combat logs.
- Learns stat weights using recursive least squares.
- Scores items in your bags and suggests upgrades.
- Safe equip queue swaps gear only out of combat.
- Tooltip line showing estimated upgrade percentage.
- Retail settings panel with options and data export.

All learning happens locally and no data is sent anywhere.
