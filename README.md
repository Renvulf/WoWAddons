# Smartbot

Smartbot is a World of Warcraft Retail addon that learns per-spec stat weights from play and can automatically equip upgrades out of combat. It integrates with Details! Damage Meter when available to obtain DPS/HPS metrics, falling back to a lightweight internal meter otherwise.

This repository also contains reference addons used for API discovery. Smartbot remains independent and stores its own saved variables.
