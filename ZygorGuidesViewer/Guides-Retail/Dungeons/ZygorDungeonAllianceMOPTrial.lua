kill Thalnos the Soulrender##59789
|tip Thalnos will Raise Fallen Crusaders. This ability summons zombies that the tank needs to pick up. When the Fallen Crusaders hit you, they leave behind Mind Rot which is a DoT that can stack.
|tip He also summons Spirit Gales often. These are puddles on the ground that should not be stepped in. This ability is interruptable.
|tip Evict Soul is a debuff that Thalnos throws on a random party member. This DoT needs to be dispelled as quickly as possible.
|tip He will also use Summon Empowering Spirit. This ability will summon an add that DPS should kill as quickly as they can. If this add reaches a Fallen Crusader's corpse, it will spawn an Empowered Zombie.
|tip Empowered Zombies are large zombies which need to be tanked. They cannot be killed without great focus.

_Phase 2_
|tip High Inquisitor Whitemane will come and and begin to fight.
|tip She will cast Power Word: Shield, Smite and Heal. Make sure to interrupt Smite and Heal.
|tip Whitemane will also try casting Mass Resurrection. DO NOT LET THIS CAST FINISH!! If this cast finishes, all corpses within 100 yards will resurrect and aggro.
|tip After you weaken her she will cast Deep Sleep. This puts the entire party to sleep for 10 seconds, during this time she will resurrect Durand.
